# GeoMine

GeoMine is a geospatial intelligence system designed to detect mineral resources by processing satellite imagery and geospatial datasets using machine learning and dimensionality reduction techniques.

## Data
- **Geospatial Datasets**: Satellite imagery, remote sensing data, and geological survey data.
- **Data Format**: Raster and vector formats (GeoTIFF, Shapefiles, CSV).
- **Features**:
  - Spectral bands
  - Geological attributes
  - Terrain and topographic indicators

## Approach
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Cleaning and standardizing geospatial data
   - Extracting key features for analysis

2. **Dimensionality Reduction (PCA)**
   - Reduces redundancy in large datasets
   - Retains the most significant features

3. **Model Selection**
   - Multiple classification algorithms tested: Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost
   - Accuracy, precision, and F1-score used for evaluation
   - Final algorithm chosen based on best performance

4. **Visualization & Validation**
   - Results mapped to geospatial layers
   - Validated with historical mineral data

## Tech Stack
- Python (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn)
- Geospatial Libraries (GDAL, GeoPandas, Rasterio)
- Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)

## How to Run
```bash
git clone https://github.com/prajesdas/GeoMine.git
cd GeoMine
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
